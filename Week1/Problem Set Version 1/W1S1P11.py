T-I-Double Guh-ER
Signs in the Hundred Acre Wood have been losing letters as Tigger bounces around stealing any letters he needs to spell out his name. 
Write a function tiggerfy() that accepts a string s, and returns a new string with the letters t, i, g, e, and r removed from it.

def tiggerfy(s):
	pass
Example Usage

s = "suspicerous"
tiggerfy(s)

s = "Trigger"
tiggerfy(s)

s = "Hunny"
tiggerfy(s)
Example Output:

"suspcous"
""
"Hunny"

        if char.lower() not in "tiger":
